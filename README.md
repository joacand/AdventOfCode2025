# Advent of Code 2025 🎄

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025).

## Inputs

As requested on the [About page](https://adventofcode.com/2025/about), the puzzle inputs are not included.
To test with your own inputs, place them in the `Data` directory using the naming pattern:
```
InputDay{day}.txt
```
where `{day}` is the day number (Example: `InputDay5.txt`).
